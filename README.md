# 🎯 Project Status & Next Steps (現在の進捗と次のステップ)

現在のプロジェクトの進捗状況と、次に進むべきステップを整理します。

## ✔ 現在の進捗

*   **GPU テスト成功**: `gpu_test.py` を使用したGPUテストは成功し、Dockerコンテナ内でのGPUアクセスが確認済みです。
*   **GPT Graph 本番処理成功**: Master / Slave / Target Product が正しく動作し、干渉画像生成（Interferogram）とフィルタリング（Goldstein filtering）まで完了しました。
*   **Docker + SNAP + GPU + ASFデータ連携成功**: これが最大の難関でしたが、Docker環境、ESA SNAP、GPUパススルー、ASFデータ連携がすべて正常に機能しています。

**🔥 つまり、InSARパイプラインの約50%が完了した地点にいます。**
干渉画像（Interferogram）とフィルタリング（Goldstein filtering）が終了した段階です。

## 📌 次にやるべき作業（優先順位順）

現在のフォルダ構成と進捗に基づき、次に進むべきステップは以下の通りです。

### 🥇 Step 1 — `run_gpt.py` を完成させる（今やるべき最重要ポイント）

現在、`scripts/run_gpt.py` を完成させ、InSARパイプラインをCLIから完全に自動化することを目指します。Master/Slaveのパス、Graph Path、出力パスをPythonスクリプトで渡せるようにします。

**例:**
```bash
python scripts/run_gpt.py \
  --master /opt/data/...SAFE \
  --slave /opt/data/...SAFE \
  --graph graphs/insar_graph.xml \
  --output /opt/data/out
```
これにより、パイプラインが「完全自動処理」になります。

### 🥈 Step 2 — SNAPHUによる位相アンラップ（Unwrapping）

現在のグラフでは、処理はInterferogramとFilteringで止まっています。変位を算出するためには、位相アンラップが必要です。

**オプション:**
*   Docker内でSNAPHUをビルドして接続する（Dockerfileに数行追加で可能）。
*   SNAPのSNAPHU-Export機能を利用し、SNAPHUを実行後、結果をインポートする（スクリプト化可能）。

### 🥉 Step 3 — LOS変位に変換（Phase → Displacement）

SNAPHUでアンラップされた位相データから、以下の計算式で変位量（ミリメートル単位）を算出します。
`unwrapped_phase × (λ / 4π)`
これはPython（NumPyなど）で簡単に自動化できます。

### 🏅 Step 4 — GeoTIFF 生成（`convert_vrt_to_tif.py`の活用）

`scripts/convert_vrt_to_tif.py` は、DIM → VRT → GeoTIFFへの後処理用スクリプトです。InSARの最終成果物としてGeoTIFF形式が望ましいため、このステップまでパイプラインを接続します。

### 🎖️ Step 5 — `generate_report.py` で自動レポート生成（任意）

PDFまたはMarkdown形式での自動レポート生成が可能な構成です。
**理想のレポート内容:**
*   入力ペア情報
*   ベースライン (bperp)
*   コヒーレンスマップ
*   変位マップ
*   可視化図

---

# 📦 System Requirements

### **Windows 10/11 + WSL2 + Docker Desktop**

*   WSL2 backend **required**
*   NVIDIA GPU + latest drivers
*   Docker Desktop with **GPU support enabled**

### **Python 3.10+ (host only for utility scripts)**

Used only for optional helper tools.

---

# ⚙️ 1. Prepare Earthdata Login (Required)

The pipeline uses **ASF Search API**, which requires NASA Earthdata credentials.

Set environment variables before running Docker:

### **PowerShell (Windows)**

```powershell
$env:EARTHDATA_USERNAME="your_earthdata_username"
$env:EARTHDATA_PASSWORD="your_earthdata_password"
```

### **Bash (Linux/WSL)**

```bash
export EARTHDATA_USERNAME=your_earthdata_username
export EARTHDATA_PASSWORD=your_earthdata_password
```
*Replace `your_earthdata_username` and `your_earthdata_password` with your actual credentials.*

---

# ⚙️ 2. Configure WSL2 Resources (Critical for SNAP)

SNAP requires **high RAM**. Without this, the process will freeze or be killed.

Create or edit:

```
%USERPROFILE%\.wslconfig
```

Add:

```ini
[wsl2]
memory=16GB
processors=6
swap=16GB
localhostForwarding=true
```

Apply changes:

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
```

Restart Docker Desktop.

Verify memory:

```bash
free -h
```

---

# ⚙️ 3. Install OLLAMA + GPU Support (Optional, Recommended)

This pipeline is designed so you can:

*   run OLLAMA on Windows host,
*   expose GPU into Docker,
*   accelerate SAR processing + AI‑based SAR assistants.

**OLLAMA Install (Windows):**
[https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)

Verify GPU access:

```powershell
ollama run llama3 "Test GPU"
```

---

# ⚙️ 4. Verify Docker GPU Access

### Test with CUDA Base Image

```powershell
docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.2.0-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi
```

### Test PyTorch GPU (for future ML modules)

```powershell
docker run --rm --gpus all -it pytorch/pytorch:2.3.0-cuda12.1-cudnn8-runtime \  
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))"
```

Should output:

```
True NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU
```

If this works, GPU passthrough is ready.

---

## 6. Example Pipeline Execution

### Step 1 — Download Sentinel‑1 SLC (Optional)

If you already have the Sentinel-1 `.SAFE` data in `./data/SAFE/`, you can skip this step.

```bash
python /opt/scripts/download_data.py \
  --start 2021-05-11 \
  --end   2021-05-11 \
  --aoi   /opt/data/aoi.geojson
```

### Step 2 — Run SNAP InSAR Graph

Execute the InSAR processing graph using ESA SNAP's Graph Processing Tool (GPT). This step performs co-registration, interferogram formation, topographic phase removal, and filtering.

**To measure execution time, you can prefix the command with `time`:**

```bash
time gpt /opt/graphs/insar_graph.xml \
  -Pmaster=/opt/data/SAFE/S1A_IW_SLC__1SDV_20210511T173941_20210511T174008_037843_047769_9526.SAFE \
  -Pslave=/opt/data/SAFE/S1A_IW_SLC__1SDV_20210530T173150_20210530T173217_038120_047FBA_A0C2.SAFE \
  -Ptarget_product=/opt/data/out/insar_filtered.dim
```

**Important:** Replace the placeholder `.SAFE` paths with the actual paths to your master and slave Sentinel-1 data within the container (e.g., `/opt/data/SAFE/YOUR_MASTER_IMAGE.SAFE`).

```bash
gpt /opt/graphs/insar_graph.xml \
  -Pmaster=/opt/data/SAFE/S1A_IW_SLC__1SDV_20210511T173941_20210511T174008_037843_047769_9526.SAFE \
  -Pslave=/opt/data/SAFE/S1A_IW_SLC__1SDV_20210530T173150_20210530T173217_038120_047FBA_A0C2.SAFE \
  -Ptarget_product=/opt/data/out/insar_filtered.dim
```

This command will take some time to complete, depending on your system resources and the size of the data.

### Step 3 — Convert VRT → GeoTIFF

```bash
python /opt/scripts/convert_vrt_to_tif.py /opt/data/out
```

### Step 4 — Generate Report

```bash
python /opt/scripts/generate_report.py /opt/data/out
```

## 5.2 What is SNAP Graph Execution? (InSAR Processing for Beginners)

The `insar_graph.xml` file used here defines a sequence of automated processing steps for Sentinel-1 radar data, executed by ESA SNAP's Graph Processing Tool (GPT). This process transforms raw satellite data into an interferogram, which can reveal millimeter-scale ground movements.

Here's a simplified breakdown:

1.  **Co-registration:**
    *   **What:** Accurately aligns two satellite images taken at different times over the same area. Imagine precisely stacking two photos of the same landscape taken days apart.
    *   **Why:** Essential for comparing the tiny phase differences between them to detect movement.
2.  **Interferogram Formation:**
    *   **What:** Creates an "interferogram" by measuring the phase difference (a property of radar waves) between the two co-registered images. This phase difference appears as a pattern of fringes (like contour lines).
    *   **Why:** These fringes contain information about ground deformation and topography.
3.  **Topographic Phase Removal:**
    *   **What:** Removes the part of the phase difference caused by the shape of the terrain (mountains, valleys). We only want the phase related to ground movement.
    *   **Why:** Isolates the phase changes directly caused by ground deformation, making them easier to observe.
4.  **Phase Filtering (e.g., Goldstein Filter):**
    *   **What:** Reduces noise in the interferogram, making the fringe patterns clearer and more interpretable.
    *   **Why:** Improves the quality of the deformation signal and helps in unwrapping the phase later.
5.  **Output (e.g., GeoTIFF):**
    *   **What:** Saves the processed interferogram into a standard geospatial format.
    *   **Why:** Allows for further analysis and visualization in GIS software.

**Important Note on GPU Usage:**
While this Docker environment is fully GPU-enabled, SNAP's core InSAR processing (including the `gpt` command with `insar_graph.xml`) is primarily **CPU-bound**. This means the GPU is not actively used during these specific InSAR steps. The GPU setup is crucial for **AI/Deep Learning workloads** (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** via tools like Ollama, which can leverage the GPU within this environment. This project demonstrates a versatile environment capable of both CPU-bound geospatial processing and GPU-accelerated AI tasks.

# Validation & Expected Outputs

After running the pipeline, you should find the following in the `mini-insar-pipeline/data/out/` directory:

*   `insar_filtered.tif`: The filtered interferogram (phase-filtered).
*   `insar_filtered.tif.png`: A visualization of the interferogram.
*   `insar_report.txt`: A short textual report with output paths.

### Sanity Checks
*   The interferogram should show coherent fringes over non-vegetated areas (coastal/urban).
*   If the interferogram is noisy (low coherence), try picking acquisition dates that are closer together.
*   If outputs are empty or you encounter an error, check the SNAP GPT logs printed to the console. Common issues include incorrect `.SAFE` paths or a missing manifest file.
